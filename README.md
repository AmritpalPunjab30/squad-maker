Squad Maker Challenge

The challenge is to create an application that separates team members.

The rules are:
	- each squad must be of equal size
	- each squad must be as closely balance as possible with respect to technical and functional skills

Each team member has the same six skills and a rating (up to 100) assigned for that particular skill. 

Each skill is classified as being either a technical skill (T), a functional skill (T), or a cross skill (X) that is equally import to both technical and functional roles.

The skills are:
	Technical:
		Programming
		Application Design
	Functional:
		Domain Expertise
		UX
	Cross:
		Communication
		Time Management

The teamMembers.json file has sample data for the team members to be separated into squads.
